I have a three.js project in which existing code allows for the project to be loaded as an html file (with supporting files) on a local web server (with localhost address). The scripts already contain several functions in which gsap is used to make specific image files appear, change in specified ways, and then disappear. These work as intended, so gsap is obviously installed. My problem is with a new function, the first that I've tried where a second command is desired to pause or stop a gsap animation, and then await a possible command to restart or replay. I have been able to get the initial gsap animation to work as desired, but not to pause or stop this animation.

According to gsap documentation, I should be able to use .totalProgress(1) (to make playback skip to the end), .pause(), .kill, or an overwrite of the present parameters, to get the animation to stop and let the objects stay still. I have tried these, as well as assigning parameters to variables and then revising the variables when desired, but none of these steps have worked for me. Evidently, there is a problem in my code in some place that I haven't known to look for a problem.

The visible objects are declared in the main section of the script. Otherwise, all of work is done in one function which has 27 lines of code (the function is 30 lines including 3 blank lines).
